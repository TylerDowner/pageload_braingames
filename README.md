# pageload_braingames
This will be a test to be later deployed on Mozilla's braingames platform

This prototype for the test loads strict/html/index.html. A click on the upper button will launch a js animation defined in the test_data variable in game.js

Each animation stimulus can be quit by clicking on the lower button.

To run the test, open game.html
