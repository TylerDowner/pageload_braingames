        <h1>Test Instructions</h1>
        <p>Thank you for your participation in this BrainGame.<br>Before we will start the test,
          please read these test instructions carefully.</p>

            <h2>What is a Braingame?</h2>
            <p>BrainGames use research techniques from cognitive science to better understand how our minds work when using the web. That understanding can improve web experiences by tailoring them around data contributed through your participation.</p>
            <p class="thick">Please do NOT do any of the following things, or you will be disqualified to prevent invalidating results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Switch tabs or programs during the procedure</li>
                <li>Zoom in or out</li>
                <li>Reload the page once you have begun trials</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>The training</h2>
            <p>In this experiment, you will load websites under different conditions.
            After each trial, we'll ask you to rate the previous page load experience on a scale from “slowest experience” to “fastest experience”.</p>
            <p>To familiarize yourself with the different conditions, we will run a training session before the actual test. During the training,
            you will experience the full range of page load experiences.</p>
            <p>Although we will already ask you to rate each trial, do not worry about your rating score. Try to find out what creates a fast or a slow
            page load experience for you. There is no right or wrong. Use the training to find out what constitutes a fast or slow experience for you.
            Trying to be consistent in your ratings during the test is all that we ask from you.</p>
